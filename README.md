# 🚀 Transactions - Assignment Rabobank

The transactions application is built with Angular 19 and allows users to view their transactions in a timeline. The transactions are grouped and ordered, with the latest transactions on top. The timeline displays the name of the other party and also the amount of the transaction. Additionally, the user can click on a single transaction to see the full details. Styling-wise the applications tries to mimic the styling of Rabobank as much as possible.
